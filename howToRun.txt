# Keypoint Detection Project â€“ Run Instructions

## Running Locally

1. Create a clean Python virtual environment:
   python -m venv keypoint_env

2. Activate the environment:
   - On Windows: keypoint_env\Scripts\activate
   - On macOS/Linux: source keypoint_env/bin/activate

3. Download all project files into a single folder:
   - This includes .h5 models, .csv annotation files, .py scripts, .ipynb notebooks, and images.

4. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Generate annotations:
   Run `generate_labels.py` to create the keypoint annotation CSV file.

6. Start experimentation:
   Open and run any of the provided `.ipynb` notebooks to train, evaluate, or visualize predictions.
